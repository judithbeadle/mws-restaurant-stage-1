# Restaurant App

An app for finding restaurants by location and type of cuisine


## Project Overview

Based on the starter project [here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) the project provides the data on a number of restaurants with information on location, cuisine and reviews as well as an image which is served up in the app in a responsive and accessible way making use of database helper functions to work offline. It also uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for a map with the restaurants.


### Running the project

In order to view the project in the browser you need to:

1. download or clone it to a folder on your computer 

2. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
